# kotlin-starter
Kotlin is a statically-typed programming language that runs on the Java virtual machine and also can be compiled to JavaScript source code or use the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Its primary development is from a team of JetBrains programmers.

This project serves as a starter kit for those who are very new to kotlin and who are willing to explore different features of this programming language.
